The only mod that simulates organic chemistry and relativity, Cyens Toy is a mod by firefreak11 that aims to revive The Science Toy and the Unrealistic Science Mod series in order to create an up-to-date version that will do more than ever before. 


Cyens Toy is a the modern successor to firefreak11's Mod, The Unrealistic Science Mod, and The Science Toy, being released in modules that contain major features that are each focused on a particular branch of science. The version number of the mod is named based on how many times I've changed the official code base since creating The Science Toy, which module is being released or updated, and the amount of small tweaks made to the module. <Official Codebase.Module.Minor Update> 

Thanks
